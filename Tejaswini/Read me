The mechanical module of a robotic project involves designing and implementing the physical structure, mechanisms, and components that make up the robot. 
Here's an overview of what the work in this module typically involves:

Past Works:

1. Mechanism  development :Research on various related concepts , Developing initial mechanisms.
2. components Selection: Identifying and selecting suitable materials and components based on variuos needed specifications and other relevant factors.
3. Designed a traversal CAD Model.
4. Research on various mechanisms which can be implemented on the designed Traversal model. for example: grippers to hold & place load, grippers for interconnection of bots, lifting mechanisms etc..
5. Designed a customised Scissor lift for CAD Model to implement verrtical traversal.


Current works:
1.Started  building prototype of the traversal model.
2. Designing a better outer body of the robot.
3.optimising the scissor lift CAD Model.

Future Works:

1. Refinement and Optimization: Continuously refining and optimizing the design based on testing results and feedback.
2. Build prototype of  Scissor lift and assemble it with traversal prototype.
3.Design grippers for interconnection of robots.
4.Build the prototype of designed gripper and assemble it to the main robot.
5. INcreasing the number of robots to Three or four.
6. Sustainability and Innovation: Exploring innovative materials or design approaches for improved performance, durability, and environmental sustainability.


As a mechanical module member, I would likely be involved in overseeing these processes, ensuring the mechanical integrity and functionality of the robot while collaborating closely with other teams for a cohesive final product.
